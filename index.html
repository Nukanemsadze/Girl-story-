	<h1>Girl's Story</h1>
	<p> I woke up in the morning, the weather was definitely not the best, but not so bad that it ruined my good mood. I was standing front of the window, when someone knocked at the door, i was not expecting anyone, so this knock was unexpected, i opened the door and there was a girl outside who was not familiar to me, but I decided to let her into the house. </p>
